Section 3 - @possess

@possess [off|<player_name>]

This command either turns possession off, if the keyword 'off' is used
as an argument, possesses a player, or reports which player is being
possessed, if no argument is passed.

All text sent to a possessed player (apart from possession reports) is
sent to the possessing player; furthermore, all commands prepended with
a '$' character will be enacted by the possessed player.
