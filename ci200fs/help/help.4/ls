Section 4 - ls

ls [<pathname>]

This produces a directory listing of the specified path; or of the
current working directory, if no path is specified.

The output is formatted into 3 columns; the first column is the permissions
on the file ('d' for directory, 'r' for readable by others, 'w' for
writable by others), the second is the owner of the file, and the third
is the filename.
