Section 2 - @open

@open <exit_name>[=<destination>]

This creates a new exit; if a destination is specified, an attempt is
made to link it to that destination.  New exits can only be created
if you own the room you're opening it in, or if you are set PRIV.

The exit name may be a series of exit names, separated by the ;
character.
