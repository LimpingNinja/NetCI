Section 7 - iterate

iterate(first_obj,except1,except2,func,...)

object first_obj,except1,except2;
string func;

This system call calls the function func on first_obj and every object
in the next_object() linked list associated with it.  It does not,
however, call the function func on the objects except1 or except2.
except1 and except2 may be null objects.
