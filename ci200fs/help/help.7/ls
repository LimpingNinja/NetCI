Section 7 - ls

ls(path)

string path;

Lists the directory named by path. It does this by calling the function
listen on this_player (if this_player is not null) or this_object,
otherwise, for each file listed.  Each string sent to listen is
formatted as follows: an integer consisting of the logically-OR'd values
of the permission flags on the file, a space, an integer corresponding
to the object which owns the file, a space, the filename, and a newline
character '\n'. ls returns 0 on success, non-zero on failure.

BUGS: the integer corresponding to the object's owner may not actually
correspond to a real object in the database, or may correspond to
a different object than that which created the file, should the original
object have been destroyed.
