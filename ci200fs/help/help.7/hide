Section 7 - hide

hide(string path)

This causes a file to be removed from the filesystem - it does NOT cause
the file to be actually deleted, it just cannot be referenced from
within CI.

All files that are created outside of CI will be initially hidden, and you
must use unhide() to bring them into CI's filesystem.

hide returns 0 on success, non-zero on failure.

NOTE: an object must be PRIV to use hide()
