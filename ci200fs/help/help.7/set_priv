Section 7 - set_priv

set_priv(obj,toggle)

object obj;
int toggle;

Sets the PRIV flag on an object, if toggle is non-zero. An object that is 
set PRIV has rights to set the PRIV flag on other objects, hide and unhide
files, read/write/create/delete rights on all files and directories, can
disconnect/reconnect network devices, and can destruct objects other than 
itself. If toggle is zero, the flag is removed.

NOTE: an object must be set PRIV to set/reset another object's PRIV flag.
