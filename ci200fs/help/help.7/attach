> Attaches the specified object to the calling object.  The functions
> defined by obj may hereafter be called as if they were local
> functions of the caller object (regardless of whether they are declared
> static or not).  All function calls made by obj will be as if made by the
> attaching object.
>
> An object may call attach() on several different objects, and may
> call attach() on an object that has itself called attach(). However,
> an attachee may not be attached-to by more than one object.
>
> Attach returns 0 on success, and non-zero on failure. This is determined
> by checking whether obj has already been attached to, and then calling
> the function "allow_attach" on obj. If allow_attach returns non-zero,
> then the attachment is allowed to proceed.
