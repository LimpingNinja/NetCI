Section 7 - attach

attach(obj)

object obj;

Attaches the specified object to the calling object.  The functions
defined by obj may hereafter be called as if they were local
functions of the caller object (regardless of whether they are declared
static or not).  All function calls made by obj will be as if made by the
attaching object.

An object may call attach() on several different objects, and may
call attach() on an object that has itself called attach(). However,
an attachee may not be attached-to by more than one object.

Attach returns 0 on success, and non-zero on failure. This is determined
by checking whether obj has already been attached to, and then calling
the function "allow_attach" on obj. If allow_attach returns non-zero,
then the attachment is allowed to proceed.
