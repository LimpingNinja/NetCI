gender_subs(actor,message)

object actor;
string message;

This function parses the string message for escape codes, and replaces
them with appropriate pronouns/names determined by the object actor's
gender. The escape codes are:

code  meaning              none    male    female  neuter  plural
----  -------              ----    ----    ------  ------  ------
%s    subjective           name    he      she     it      they
%o    objective            name    him     her     it      them
%p    possessive           name's  his     hers    its     their
%a    absolute possessive  name's  his     hers    its     theirs
%n    name                 name    name    name    name    name

If the escape code is capitalized, the substitution will also be
capitalized.
