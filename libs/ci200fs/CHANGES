o Added in the ; command which works like in TinyMUSH.  Added a new hear
  just for that.  Also edited help for it.

o In /sys/sys.c, changed find_player so that it also recognises the
  use of 'me', as in TinyMUD.

o Added the commands email, rlname, and url, for setting these values
  on characters, so they can be referenced by the finger command and
  other informational commands.  Added in help

o Added in the finger command, so far it just shows character name,
  rlname, url, and email.  I'd like to add in informatino about the
  character itself like login/out times.

o Changes to hear(), hear is now in the format:
  hear(actor,actee,type,message,pre,post), the pre, and post messages
  are added as necessary.

o Minor changes to examine.

10/6/95
o Fixed crlf bug in listen() in player.c

10/7/95

o The mudlib now keeps track of when you connect and log off.  This is
  mostly for fun, but does have some useful applications.  Advance plan:
  change the welcome so that it tells you when you were last on.

10/10/95

o Added in the @wrap command, listen() now handles word wrapping (still
need to make small mod so that it remembers cursor position).

o find_any_object now checks for me,home,and root first.

o find_player now does a check on who is connected (like find_object does).
  (If threnody is connected you could do just page thren and it would
   match to her).

10/11/95

o News now takes an optional argument for other news files.  News is now
  stored in /etc/news.  The default file is still news.

o Added some new help items.

10/19/95

o Site List is working.  Help will be written for it soon.

o Created strings.h, so far just has pad() and center(), more
  coming as needed.

o Cleaning up source files, used pad in place of make_space and
  make_dash in sys.c, need to remove make_space and make_dash

o Logging in now displays the last time you logged in and tells
  you how long you were logged in for.

o Lots of small cleanups here and there

12/28/23

o Corrected malformed sitelist

o Moved ci200fs to subfolder libs/ in preparation for mudlib 'lil' creation
