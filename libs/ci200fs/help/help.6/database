Section 6 - database

The database is arranged in several ways; the first way is a linked list
of object prototypes, each link having a list of children hanging off it.
(note: the object prototype is itself an object). Destroying the object
prototype results in the destruction of all child objects. The head of
the linked list of prototypes is always /boot#0. Prototype objects are
created by compiling source code.

The second way the database is arranged is by location and contents.
Each object may or may not be in a containing object, and may or may
not have a linked list of contained objects associated with it. The
linked lists are guaranteed not to be cyclic.
