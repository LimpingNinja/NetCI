Section 2 - @lock

@lock <object>=<expression>

This locks an object (so it can be taken only by objects for whom
expression evaluates true), an exit (so it can only be used by
objects for whom expression holds true), or a room (this has no
effect other than whether a succ/osucc message set is displayed,
or a fail/ofail message set is displayed).

The expression may consists of object names (which returns TRUE
if the player possesses that particular object), the operators
"|", "&", and "!", and the operators present(string,location),
holding(string), call(object,function_name) and gender(x). present()
returns true if string can identify an object in the specified location.
holding() returns true if string identifies an object the player
is holding. call() returns true if calling the function on the
specified object returns true. Only players set PROGRAMMER can use
call(). gender(x) returns true if the player's gender is set to
x (one of male, female, neuter, plural, spivak, or none).
