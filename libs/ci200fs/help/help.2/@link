Section 2 - @link

@link <object>=<destination>

This command causes an object to have its home set to destination,
a room to have its drop-to set to destination (this is the location
objects dropped in that room are sent to), a player to have his/her
home set to destination, or an exit to have its destination set.

The player must either own the destination, or the destination must
be set LINK_OK.

If it is an unlinked exit being linked, anyone is permitted to link it;
upon linking, the linking player becomes the owner of the exit.
