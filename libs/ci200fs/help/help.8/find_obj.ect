Section 8 - find_object

call_other(PlayerObject,"find_object",ObjectName)

This function is not defined like the other library functions; it must
be called explicitly with a call_other to the player object. It returns
an object pointer to an object identifiable by the ObjectName string,
by that player object, or 0 if an object cannot be found.
