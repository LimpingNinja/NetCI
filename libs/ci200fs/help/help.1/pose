Section 1 - pose

pose <action>

This causes your character to emote an action; this may be abbreviated
to ':<action>'.
You may also use ;, which emotes an action, but with no space after
your name.  For Example: the command ':'s box is big.' produces
'<yourname>'s box is big.'.

pose is functionally equivalent to emote.
