@system [<option>=<value>]

With no options, @system displays the current system parameter values.

The options are:

  doingquery          This is the message set at the top of the who list

  find                This turns the @find command 'on' or 'off'; on any
                      reasonably-sized database, the @find command will
                      cause cache overflows.

  guests              This turns guest character connections 'on' or 'off'.

  names		This turns player name changing 'on' or 'off'. The
			default value for this is off.

  newchar             These are the flags set on newly created characters;
                      the only valid values are 'builder', 'programmer',
                      and 'builder | programmer'

  registration        This turns character registration 'on' or 'off';
                      if registration is turned on, the file /etc/register
                      will be displayed when an attempt to create a new
                      character is made.

  whoquote            This is the message set at the bottom of the who list.
