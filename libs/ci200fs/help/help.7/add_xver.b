Section 7 - add_xverb

add_xverb(action,func)

string action,func;

add_xverb adds an xverb to the list of verbs on the object executing the
system call. If add_xverb is called on the prototype, all the prototype's
children will have the xverb defined for them.

xverbs differ from regular verbs in that no space has to appear after
the xverb's name in the player's command for the xverb to be recognized
by the parser.

xverb returns 0 on success, 1 on failure.
