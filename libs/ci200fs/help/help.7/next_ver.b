next_verb(obj,verb)

object obj;
string verb;

Returns a string containing the next verb name defined on object obj,
after verb.  If verb is NULL, the first verb name listed on object obj
is returned. If no further verbs are defined on the object, NULL is
returned.

The last verb added to an object is always the first verb listed on it.

NOTE: This will not list verbs defined on the prototype object if obj
      is not the prototype itself.
